# BIP-Technical-Test
Technical Task by Macarena Cruz, solutions in both ipynb and py format

Task: Write a function that finds the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum within an array read in input to the function. The function should return the sub-array and the corresponding sum. Which is the complexity of your solution? Can you do a solution with linear complexity? Write a unit test for the function.
